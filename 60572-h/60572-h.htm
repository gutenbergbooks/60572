<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_1">1</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The United States was created in
Philadelphia on July 4, 1776, when the
Continental Congress voted the final form
of the Declaration of Independence. The
United States was perpetuated on September
17, 1787, when the Federal Convention completed
its work on the Constitution and referred
it, through Congress, to the individual
states for ratification. Both these great decisions
were made in the same chamber in
what is now called Independence Hall, but
was then the Pennsylvania State House. It
would still be merely the old State House if
independence had not been achieved and if
the Constitution had not been ratified and
put into effect. The noble building, so venerable
to later ages, might not even have
survived, but might have been swept away
in the surging growth of a modern city. In
that case, a few students of history would
sometimes remember the site as the stage of
those lost causes. Instead, Pennsylvania&rsquo;s State
House has become Independence Hall for the
entire United States. Nor is that all. On account
of the Declaration of Independence, it
is a shrine honored wherever the rights of
men are honored. On account of the Constitution,
it is a shrine cherished wherever the
principles of self-government on a federal
scale are cherished.</i>&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Carl van Doren.</span></p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small"><i>The Provincial State House</i></span></h2>
<p>Independence Hall was originally the State House of Pennsylvania.
For a half century after the establishment of the Province, the government
had no official building. The Assembly, a small legislative body,
was compelled to meet in private dwellings rented annually for the
purpose or in the old City Hall at Second and High (now Market)
Streets.</p>
<p>In order to meet the needs of the Province, funds were appropriated
for the construction of the State House in 1729. At the same time a
committee, consisting of Speaker of the Assembly Andrew Hamilton,
Assemblyman Dr. John Kearsley, and Councilman Thomas Lawrence,
was named to supervise the job. Strong disagreement arose between
Hamilton and Kearsley, with each supporting a different location and
plan. This disagreement delayed actually beginning work on the
building until 1732. In that year the Assembly approved the plan
Hamilton advocated and selected the south side of Chestnut Street
between Fifth and Sixth Streets as the site. This was then on the
outskirts of the city.</p>
<p>In the 1730&rsquo;s, Philadelphia had a population of almost 11,500 people.
Only Boston, with 13,000, was larger; while New York was third,
with 8,500. The area of what was to become Independence Square
contained only a few small houses. The uneven ground was covered
on the north with whortleberry bushes; to the south, across Walnut
Street, stood a peach orchard.</p>
<p>It is apparent that the plans from which the State House was constructed
were drawn by Edmund Woolley, master carpenter, who was
also the principal builder under the direction of Andrew Hamilton.
To these two men go the major credit for the design and erection of
one of the most beautiful administrative buildings of the Colonial
period.</p>
<p>Building the State House was a slow process. The Assembly was
not able to meet in the new building until September 1735. Even at
that time the walls had not been paneled, nor had all of the window
panes been installed. Difficulties of various kinds, especially the
scarcity of skilled workmen, kept the building in an unfinished state.
Finally, in the summer of 1741, the impatient Assembly ordered that
the walls and windows of their chamber be finished at once and the
remainder of the building completed without undue delay. Despite
this order, plans for completing the Supreme Court chamber were
not submitted until November 1743. The Council Chamber on the
upper floor was not ready for occupancy until February 1748. It
appears probable that the building was completed about this date.</p>
<p>During construction of the State House the old custom of &ldquo;raising
feasts&rdquo; was followed. When the main timbers in a building were
raised, a sumptuous feast was given for the workmen in celebration of
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
the event. As the building of the State House progressed, there were
a number of such feasts, the cost of them borne by the Provincial
government.</p>
<p>Shortly after the construction of the State House was started, the
Assembly ordered that office buildings be erected as wings to the main
building, for the safekeeping of the public papers of the Province.
Early in 1736 the wings on each side of the State House were practically
completed, but public officials objected strenuously to moving into
them. Despite objections, however, it is obvious that the wings were
soon occupied by various county and provincial officials. Others also
used these small buildings, for in 1739 the Library Company of Philadelphia
was granted permission to deposit its books in the upper floor
of the west wing. The Library remained there until 1773 when it
was moved to Carpenters&rsquo; Hall. Throughout the Colonial period the
doorkeeper of the Assembly and his family also lived in the west wing.
Furthermore, during the early years, Indian delegations visiting Philadelphia
were sometimes lodged in one of the wings.</p>
<p>These exotic tenants proved a source of worry to the Assembly.
Their carelessness with fire posed such a serious threat to public records
that, in 1759, the Assembly ordered the erection of a separate building
for the use of the Indians. It is thought that one of the two wooden
sheds built before the Revolution at the corners of Fifth and Sixth
Streets on Chestnut Street was used for this purpose.</p>

<p>Although the 15 years required to build the State House must have
been a source of irritation to legislators eager to occupy it, the completed
building proved the time was well spent. A most ambitious
project for that early date, it emerged a sturdily constructed brick
edifice&mdash;described at the time as a &ldquo;large handsome building&rdquo;&mdash;with
a facade 107 feet in length connected by closed arcades, or &ldquo;piazzas,&rdquo;
to wing buildings some 50 feet long. The main building had a decked
gable roof, balustraded between the chimneys and surmounted by a
centrally located cupola. The interior arrangement of the State House
provided suitable space for the various agencies of government. The
first floor contained two chambers about 40 feet square, separated by
a spacious center hall about 20 feet wide. The eastern chamber served
as the meeting place of the Assembly. This room, in the words of a
contemporary in 1774, was &ldquo;finished in a neat but not elegant manner.&rdquo;
Since the Assembly&rsquo;s sessions were usually secret, the room was provided
with a door. The western chamber housed the Supreme Court
of the Province and was entered through open archways. The staircase
to the upper floor occupied the south end of the central hall.
The Provincial Council, the Governor&rsquo;s advisory body, met in a
chamber approximately 20 by 40 feet in the southwestern corner of
the upper floor. This room was separated by a small vestibule from a
chamber in the southeast corner which was designed as a committee
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
room of the Assembly. The entire Chestnut Street frontage was one
room, called the &ldquo;gallery,&rdquo; or &ldquo;long room,&rdquo; measuring 100 by 20 feet.
The gallery was used generally for public entertainment and banquets.</p>
<p>It is apparent that the State House was not elegantly furnished.
Chairs, tables, curtains, screens, and other items purchased for the
building were never unduly expensive. However, the silver inkstand,
purchased from Philip Syng, of Philadelphia, for the table of the
Speaker of the Assembly, and still preserved in Independence Hall,
was a most unusual item which cost &pound;25-16-0. The building appears
to have been heated originally by open fireplaces for which stoves
were later substituted. Lighting was not a serious problem since the
meetings rarely continued until darkness; when they did, the Assembly
ordered that candles be brought in. There is no known picture
of the interior of the State House during the Colonial period; the
earliest representation is a painting of the Assembly Room by Pine
and Savage, &ldquo;The Congress Voting Independence,&rdquo; which was
executed in 1784-86.</p>
<p>In January 1750, shortly after the State House was completed, the
Assembly authorized the superintendents of the building to erect a
tower to contain a staircase and belfry. Edmund Woolley was
entrusted with the construction. By 1753, the tower was completed
and the State House bell (now called the Liberty Bell), ordered in
1751, was hung.</p>
<p>The Assembly also ordered a &ldquo;large Clock to strike on the Bell.&rdquo;
Subsequently, its works were installed in the attic of the State House,
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
with clock faces in the end walls just below the eaves. Under the
face of that clock in the west end, a masonry structure resembling a
tall case clock was constructed, the hands of both timepieces being
moved by rods connected with the mechanism in the attic. The
steeple bell, however, was not used to strike the hours. A second bell
was ordered by the Assembly, in 1752, for that purpose and was placed
in a turret on the main roof just before the tower.</p>

</div>
<p>In February 1752, in order to accommodate its committees, the
Assembly ordered the erection of a suitable room adjoining the southeast
corner of the building. Work was begun immediately, and the
room was completed some time during the following year. Demolished
probably around 1812, the chamber was described by a contemporary
as &ldquo;a very elegant apartment.&rdquo; This room also served as the
library of the Assembly and was well equipped with sets of English
statutes along with works on history and literature.</p>
<p>With the completion of the committee room and library, no additional
structures were erected in the State House Yard during the
Colonial period. However, other buildings were contemplated. On
February 20, 1736, the Assembly reserved the lots on Chestnut Street
at the corners of Fifth and Sixth Streets for the erection of a city
hall and county courthouse within the next 20 years, but these
buildings were not constructed until several years after the Revolution.</p>

direction was the restoration of a steeple to the building. William Strickland, the
famous American architect, designed a new one which was constructed in 1828;
it was not an exact replica, but followed the general design of its predecessor
removed in 1781. The principal deviations were the installation of a clock in the

<p>Philadelphia, the metropolis of English America, was destined to become
even more prominent during the American Revolution. As
opposition to England&rsquo;s colonial policy developed in America, the
city&rsquo;s location near the center of colonial America naturally made
it the focal point of government. The long tension between the American
colonies and the mother country, which had led to occasional
acts of violence in the past, again erupted in 1773 when a group of
Bostonians destroyed a shipment of tea. Instead of making an effort
to discover the nature of the Americans&rsquo; opposition, the English Government
attempted to punish them by closing the port of Boston.</p>
<p>The Americans promptly chose representatives to an intercolonial
congress which was to become known as the First Continental
Congress. This body, composed of leading citizens of the colonies,
gathered on September 5, 1774, at the City Tavern before convening
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
formally at Carpenters&rsquo; Hall, a new building erected by the Carpenters&rsquo;
Company of Philadelphia. Reluctant to adopt a course of open defiance,
the Congress sent a petition to the King asking him to restore
those rights of Englishmen which Parliament seemed determined to
take away. In answer to the English acts of coercion, the Congress
turned to economic pressure by calling upon Americans to boycott
English goods. Although the First Continental Congress protested
strongly against violations of the &ldquo;rights of Englishmen&rdquo; claimed for
the American colonists, no demand for independence was made.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>After the first Congress adjourned on October 26, 1774, relations
between the colonies and the mother country grew steadily worse.
On April 19, 1775, the Minute Men of Massachusetts fought the British
forces at Lexington and Concord, thus challenging the armed might
of the British Empire. About a month later, on May 10, the Second
Continental Congress met in an atmosphere of tension in the Assembly
Room of the State House. The governing body, forced by events,
moved from protest to resistance. Under the Presidency of John
Hancock, the Congress (in June) chose George Washington to be
General and Commander in Chief of the Army. The latter, &ldquo;from
his usual modesty, darted into the library-room&rdquo; when his name was
first suggested by John Adams. But after a unanimous election,
Washington accepted that commission in the Assembly Room and
left shortly thereafter to assume his most difficult duties. Despite the
outbreak of warfare, this session of the Continental Congress adjourned
on August 1, 1775, without a demand for independence.</p>
<p>When the Congress reconvened on September 5, 1775, in the State
House, King George III had already issued a proclamation (August 23,
1775) declaring that &ldquo;open and avowed rebellion&rdquo; existed in the
colonies. This and other actions of the King, as well as the publication
in Philadelphia of Thomas Paine&rsquo;s <i>Common Sense</i>, caused public
sentiment in favor of independence to grow rapidly in 1776. It was
a difficult task, however, to overcome the reluctance of the conservative
delegates to make an open break.</p>

<p>Not until June 7, 1776, did Richard Henry Lee, of Virginia, acting
on instructions from the Virginia Convention, offer a resolution
declaring, &ldquo;That these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be,
free and independent States,&rdquo; and that foreign alliances and a plan
of confederation ought to be created. Then, after 2 days of debate,
consideration of the resolution was postponed for several weeks.
Meanwhile, a committee, composed of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams,
Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, and Robert R. Livingston was
named to draft a declaration &ldquo;setting forth the causes which impelled
us to this mighty resolution.&rdquo; On July 2, 1776, Lee&rsquo;s resolution was
adopted after a heated debate in which Adams played a dominant
role. Two days later, the Congress formalized this act by adopting
the Declaration of Independence. On August 2, after it had been
engrossed, the document was signed by most members of Congress.
These drastic and irrevocable actions, in effect, marked the end of
British authority in the American colonies and the birth of the United
States of America.</p>
<p>The Declaration of Independence is one of the greatest statements
of the principles of democracy ever penned. Written largely by
Thomas Jefferson, it expressed the thoughts and feelings not only of
the assembled delegates but also of that part of the American people
bent on freedom and independence. These thoughts, expressed in the
measured cadence of Jefferson&rsquo;s lines, gave the colonists a creed to be
triumphantly established: &ldquo;That to secure these rights [Life, Liberty
and the pursuit of Happiness], Governments are instituted among
Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
Here is the continuing principle now permanently entrenched as the
heart of American democracy.</p>
<p>To institute such a government required the agonies of a long, often
indecisive and frequently discouraging war. Throughout the many
and hard years of the Revolution, the Congress sat in the State House,
except for periods of danger such as the occupation of Philadelphia
by the British forces from September 1777 to June 1778. During
that winter, Washington&rsquo;s small army endured untold hardships while
keeping watch at Valley Forge when the American cause appeared
almost hopeless.</p>
<p>In 1778, however, the cause received new strength. Largely through
the astute diplomacy of Benjamin Franklin, an alliance was formed
with France; and, on August 6, 1778, Conrad Alexandre G&eacute;rard, the
first French Minister to this Nation, formally presented his credentials
to Congress in the Assembly Room.</p>
<p>With the flow of men, money, and supplies from France, the war
was brought to a virtual conclusion at Yorktown, Va., in 1781. When
Washington&rsquo;s dispatches reporting this victory were received by the
Congress in the State House, on October 24, celebrations and general
rejoicing were held throughout Philadelphia. About a week later,
Congress was presented with 24 stands of colors captured at Yorktown.</p>
<p>The formation of a confederation for the new nation was an even
more difficult task than obtaining agreement to the Declaration of
Independence, and steps to form such a confederation were taken
very early in the Revolution. As a matter of fact, only 8 days after the
Declaration was adopted, a draft constitution, called the Articles of
Confederation and Perpetual Union, was first reported by a committee
to the Congress. In spite of the need for unity to meet the enemy&rsquo;s
threat, the States were not willing to commit themselves to the various
obligations (small though they now seem) required in the proposed
confederation. Maryland, in particular, insisted that, as a condition
of her acquiescence, certain other States first surrender their claims
to western lands. On July 9, 1778, eight States signed the Articles of
Confederation in the Pennsylvania State House. Maryland did not
accede until 4 years later, after Virginia, Massachusetts, and Connecticut
gave up their claims to the region which became known as the
Northwest Territory. However, the new Articles of Confederation,
giving the revolutionary government constitutional standing, did not
begin their short period of effectiveness until March 1, 1781.</p>
<p>This first frame of government did not attempt to form a powerful
national government; under the Articles of Confederation the States
retained almost the power of independent nations. However, the
Articles did create a Congress which could consider and legislate
matters affecting the Nation as a whole. Although they contained certain
weaknesses, they held together the 13 States long enough for
responsible leaders to discover the kind of government the United
States must have.</p>

<p>During those critical years, the State House had served the new
nation well as a capitol. As already noted, it was in this building that
Congress had organized the national administration and made the
necessary plans for carrying the war through to its successful conclusion.
The Provincial Assembly of Pennsylvania, meanwhile, having
graciously relinquished its accustomed room to Congress, had carried
on as best it could in a crowded space on the second floor of the State
House.</p>
<p>The occupation of Philadelphia by the British had been a period of
distress not only for the American cause but for the State House as
well. The building had first been used as quarters for British troops.
After the battle of Germantown, it served as a hospital for wounded
American soldiers.</p>
<p>These uses of the building had left it, in the words of a member
of the Congress, in &ldquo;a most filthy and sordid situation,&rdquo; with &ldquo;the
inside torn much to pieces.&rdquo; Extensive cleaning and repairs were
required to refit the building for meetings of the State Government
and the Congress. The Assembly took advantage of this need for
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
repairs to enlarge their temporary quarters in the southeast corner of
the upper floor. This was done by removing the partition between
their chamber and the &ldquo;long room.&rdquo; The new space then became
approximately the same size as the Assembly Room on the first floor.</p>

<p>The Revolutionary period also saw an alteration on the exterior of
the State House&mdash;the removal of the badly decayed wooden steeple
above the brick tower. The Assembly considered this step as early as
1773, but the project was not carried out until 1781. After the steeple
was removed, the brick tower was covered with a low, sloping, hipped
roof, surmounted by a slender finial.</p>
<p>In 1783, a body of mutinous soldiers surrounded the State House
and demanded back pay from Congress. Although the members of
Congress were unharmed, the incident led to their moving to Princeton.
The Congress of the Confederation never returned to the State
House.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">&ldquo;<i>To Form a More Perfect Union</i>&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>With the return of peace in 1783 came also postwar depression. Hard
times created discontent. By 1786, in Massachusetts, this flared into an
open insurrection known as Shays&rsquo; Rebellion. This affair (perhaps
not so serious as often painted) helped point up the weakness of
Congress and intensify the movement already begun to amend the
Articles of Confederation. A stronger central government was needed.
As a result, a convention was called by the Congress.</p>

<p>The Federal Constitutional Convention opened in Philadelphia on
May 25, 1787, in the same room in the State House where the
Declaration of Independence had been adopted. This room permitted
the delegates to meet in secret session, which suggests the seriousness
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
the delegates attached to their responsibilities. The Convention, composed
of 55 men chosen by the legislatures of the States, was a small
group, but included the best minds in America. As a matter of course,
they chose George Washington to be the presiding officer; his endorsement
was probably the chief factor in winning acceptance for
the Constitution. The leader on the floor, and in some ways the most
effective man in the Convention, was James Madison. His efforts
were ably seconded by James Wilson, who deserves to be ranked with
Madison on the basis of actual influence on the completed Constitution.
The aged Benjamin Franklin was the seer of the group; his great
service was as peacemaker of the Convention. Gouverneur Morris,
brilliant and coherent debater, was responsible for the very apt wording
of the Constitution in its final form. Other important delegates
included George Mason, Elbridge Gerry, William Paterson, Charles
Pinckney, and Roger Sherman.</p>

<p>The purpose of the Convention was, as stated in the Preamble to
the Constitution, &ldquo;to form a more perfect Union&rdquo; among the States,
to ensure peace at home, and to provide for defense against foreign
enemies. The delegates believed that these objects could best be
achieved by establishing a strong national government, but it was soon
apparent that serious disagreements existed as to the nature of this
proposed new government. Throughout the hot summer months, the
delegates labored. The Constitution was not born at once, but developed
gradually through debate, interchange of opinion, and careful
consideration of problems. Many minds contributed to its final form.
A body of compromises, the Constitution created the central government
of a land which is both a nation and a confederation of States.
It was impossible for the framers to attempt to answer all questions;
much was left for future generations to define. As a result, the Constitution
has proved to be a most elastic instrument, readily adaptable
to meet changing conditions.</p>

<p>On September 17, 1787, 4 months after the Convention had assembled,
the finished Constitution was signed &ldquo;By unanimous consent
of the States present.&rdquo; The Federal Convention was over. The members
&ldquo;adjourned to the City Tavern, dined together, and took a cordial
leave of each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Often during the bitterness of debate, the Convention&rsquo;s outcome was
in doubt. At the signing, Franklin, pointing to the gilded half-sun
on the back of Washington&rsquo;s chair, observed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have often and often in the course of Session, and the vicissitudes of
my hopes and fears as to its issue, looked at that [sun] behind the President
without being able to tell whether it was rising or setting: But now
at length I have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a
setting Sun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Completion of work by the Federal Convention was merely the beginning
of the struggle for the new Constitution; the crucial part
remained. For the framework upon which the Convention had expended
so much thought and labor could be made law only by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
people. This was to be accomplished by submitting the document
to the people for their approval or disapproval in popularly elected
State conventions. This method would serve to give the Constitution
a broad base of popular support. Such support was particularly necessary,
since the Convention made clearly revolutionary decisions in
stating that the approbation of 9 States would be sufficient for establishing
the Constitution over the States so ratifying, and that the consent
of the Congress was not required.</p>

</div>
<p>In State after State special elections were held in which the issue was
whether the voters favored or did not favor the proposed Constitution.
Pennsylvania&rsquo;s State Convention met in the State House on November
21, 1787. Under the influence of Wilson&rsquo;s vigorous arguments, that
body ratified the Constitution on December 18. The honor of first
ratification, however, went to Delaware. Her convention ratified the
document unanimously 5 days earlier. Several of the smaller States
adhered shortly thereafter. The sharpest contests took place in Massachusetts,
Virginia, and New York where the Anti-Federalists were
strong and ably led; but the advantages of the Constitution were so
great that it was finally ratified in 1788 by 11 States. Rhode Island and
North Carolina held out until after Washington became President.</p>
<p>In order to meet popular objections to the Constitution, the Federalists
in Massachusetts drafted amendments which their Commonwealth,
in ratifying the Constitution, might propose to the other
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
States for adoption. This clever device helped win the struggle in
several reluctant States. From these suggested amendments, intended
to protect the individual citizen against the central government, the
first 10 amendments to the Constitution, called the Bill of Rights, were
formed. When the Constitution was finally ratified, the Congress
arranged for the first national election and declared the new government
would go into operation on March 4, 1789.</p>
<p>The new Federal Government first began its work in New York
where Federal Hall Memorial National Historic Site is now located;
then, in 1790, the Government came to Philadelphia. The move to
Philadelphia resulted from a compromise known as the Residence
Act, approved July 16, 1790. This act directed that the permanent
capital was to be situated on the Potomac, but it also stipulated that
the temporary seat of government was to be in Philadelphia for 10 years.
Robert Morris was generally credited with bringing the capital to
Philadelphia and was castigated by New Yorkers for his part in its
removal from their city.</p>

</div>
<p>When the location of the capital was under consideration, the City
and County of Philadelphia, as well as the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
offered the Federal Government the use of the City Hall
and the County Courthouse, two new buildings then under construction.
These buildings fulfilled the original plan of a governmental
center as conceived by Andrew Hamilton. The offer was accepted
and for the last 10 years of the 18th century the United States Congress
sat in the new County Courthouse (now known as Congress Hall), on
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
the west side of the State House, and the U. S. Supreme Court, in
the new City Hall (Supreme Court Building), on the east.</p>
<p>The building in which the Supreme Court sat from 1791 on was
erected by the City of Philadelphia to accommodate the growth of
municipal departments and functions. During the Colonial period
the city government occupied the small courthouse at Second and
High (now Market) Streets. When the Federal Government came to
Philadelphia, the new building was not yet completed, and the Supreme
Court of the United States met first in the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court Chamber in the State House. After August 1, 1791, the Supreme
Court generally occupied the Mayor&rsquo;s Court, the large room at the
south end of the first floor, in the new City Hall. It is possible that
the corresponding room on the second floor was also used on occasions
by the high tribunal. During its occupancy of the building, the Supreme
Court was first presided over by John Jay, who was succeeded in turn
as Chief Justice by John Rutledge and Oliver Ellsworth. Here the
court began its active work, thereby laying the foundation for the
development of the Judicial Branch of the Federal Government.</p>

</div>
<p>The ground on which Congress Hall stands was purchased for the
Province of Pennsylvania in 1736. Although there had been plans for
a long time to erect a courthouse on the lot, it was not until 1785 that
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
the Assembly of Pennsylvania passed an act to appropriate funds for
the erection of the building. Work began in 1787 and was completed
in 1789. This county court building became the meeting place of the
first United States Congress, Third Session, on December 6, 1790.
Frederick Augustus Muhlenberg was then Speaker of the House and
John Adams, President of the Senate. It is today the oldest building
standing in which the Congress of the United States has met.</p>

</div>
<p>Before the courthouse could be turned over to the United States
Congress, alterations had to be made to fit the building for its new
purpose. The first-floor chamber, to be used by the House of Representatives,
was furnished with mahogany tables and elbow chairs, carpeting,
stoves, and venetian blinds&mdash;all of fine workmanship. In addition,
a gallery was constructed to hold about 300 people. The Senate Chamber
on the second floor was even more elegantly furnished.</p>
<p>Then, between 1793 and 1795, to accommodate the increase in membership
of the House from 68 to 106, the building had to be enlarged
by an addition of about 26 feet to the end of the original structure.
In 1795, a gallery was constructed for the Senate Chamber similar to,
although smaller than, the one on the floor below.</p>
<p>The decade during which Philadelphia served as the capital was a
formative period for our new Government. In foreign relations, the
Citizen Gen&ecirc;t affair and other repercussions of the French Revolution,
which brought near-hostilities with France, ended the historic Franco-American
Alliance of 1778. It is impossible to list all the great events
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
which occurred during that period, but among them must be mentioned
the inauguration of Washington for his second term in the
Senate Chamber on March 4, 1793. At the same time John Adams
assumed the Presidency of the Senate. Washington delivered his last
formal message before Congress, prior to retiring, in the chamber of
the House of Representatives on December 7, 1796. It is this message
which some have confused with Washington&rsquo;s famous Farewell
Address.</p>
<p>It was in Congress Hall that the first 10 amendments&mdash;the Bill of
Rights&mdash;were formally added to the Constitution. It was here also
that the First Bank of the United States and the Mint were established
as part of the comprehensive program developed by Alexander Hamilton,
Secretary of the Treasury, to rectify the disordered state of
Government finances. Here, too, Jay&rsquo;s Treaty with England was
debated and ratified; Vermont, Kentucky, and Tennessee were admitted
into the Union; and the Alien and Sedition Acts were passed.
And it was here that the Federal Government successfully weathered
an internal threat to its authority&mdash;the Whiskey Insurrection of 1794.</p>

<p>In the chamber of the House of Representatives, John Adams was
inaugurated as second President of the United States on March 4,
1797. Two years later, official news of the death of Washington was
received here by Congress, at which time John Marshall introduced
Henry (&ldquo;Light-Horse Harry&rdquo;) Lee&rsquo;s famous words: &ldquo;First in War,
First in Peace, First in the Hearts of his Countrymen.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small"><i>After 1800</i></span></h2>
<p>With the turn of the century, Philadelphia ceased to be a capital city.
In 1800, the Federal Government moved to Washington. During the
previous year, the State Government had moved first to Lancaster
and later to Harrisburg. Congress Hall and the Supreme Court building
reverted to the uses for which they were originally intended&mdash;a
county courthouse and a city hall. The State House became an empty
building, used apparently only at elections.</p>

<p>The Governor, on March 13, 1815, approved an act authorizing
the County Commissioners of Philadelphia to take charge of the State
House and to rent out the space as they considered advisable. All
profits obtained were to be used to make repairs and improvements
on the building.</p>
<p>Having released the State from responsibility for its State House,
the Legislature next sought to realize from this property a sum of
money to be used in building the new capitol at Harrisburg. In an
act, approved March 11, 1816, the Legislature provided for the sale
of the square and its buildings. This act required the Governor to
appoint three commissioners (none from Philadelphia) to lay out a
street, or streets, through the square &ldquo;in such manner as in their
opinion will most conduce to the value of the property.&rdquo; The square
was to be divided into lots suitable for building; the total amount to be
realized was not to be less than $150,000.</p>
<p>One section of the act, however, saved the State House. This provided
that the City of Philadelphia should have the privilege of
purchasing the building and square for the sum of $70,000. The City
Councils promptly passed an ordinance to purchase the property and
took title on March 23, 1818. This was a financial and spiritual investment
unequaled in the history of American cities.</p>
<p>Although the City of Philadelphia had saved the State House and
its sister buildings from possible destruction, it was evident that many
local officials did not consider the ensemble worthy of complete
preservation. As early as 7 years prior to purchasing this property
from the State, municipal authorities presented the Legislature with
petitions requesting that the Commissioners of the City and County
of Philadelphia be permitted &ldquo;to pull down the east and west wings
of the state-house ... and to erect in their place, suitable buildings
for the deposit of the records of said City and county....&rdquo; On March
24, 1812, this authority was granted by the State Government. The old
wings and the committee room were demolished, to be replaced by
&ldquo;modern&rdquo; office buildings designed by the architect, Robert Mills.
These new offices consisted of two row buildings attached to the east
and west ends of the State House. Often called &ldquo;State House row,&rdquo;
they were occupied by various officials of the city, county, and federal
governments.</p>
<p>Other changes to the State House followed as a result of the City&rsquo;s
desire to adapt it for current needs. The Assembly Room, in which
the Declaration of Independence had been adopted, was converted
into a court room. This was &ldquo;modernized&rdquo; by the removal of its
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
paneling and the substitution of plaster and paint. Furthermore, the
Chestnut Street doorway was replaced by a more ornate one, which
was wholly out of keeping with the simple dignity of the structure.</p>

</div>
<p>The first occupant after the State government moved to Lancaster
was Charles Willson Peale, who, in 1802, received permission to use
the upper floor of the State House (including the tower rooms) and
the Assembly Room on the first floor, for his museum which had
occupied Philosophical Hall since 1794. By the terms of the agreement,
Peale was responsible for the maintenance of both the building and
the State House Yard.</p>
<p>In order to make the building more suitable for his museum, Peale
removed the alterations made in 1778-79 to accommodate the Assembly,
and rebuilt the long room to appear as it did during the
Colonial period. The museum, which occupied the second floor of the
State House until 1828, included not only an extensive collection of
natural history items but also a unique portrait gallery of the great men
of this Nation, painted largely by Charles Willson Peale and his son,
Rembrandt. Peale also took most seriously his charge to care for the
State House Yard, or Garden, as Independence Square was then
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
known. He planted trees, added new gates and benches, and improved
the walls and lawns. It was most fortunate that a man of
Peale&rsquo;s caliber was responsible for the property&rsquo;s care during this
dark period.</p>

<p>After Peale&rsquo;s museum moved from the State House in 1827-28, the
second floor was rented to the United States Government for judicial
purposes. Alterations were made under the direction of the architect,
John Haviland, to adapt the space for its new use. The long room was
again obliterated, and the western portion of the upper floor was made
into one large room for the use of the United States Circuit and District
Courts. The partitions in the eastern portion apparently were retained;
the northern room became the jury room for the court and the
southern room, the office of its clerk. This occupancy of the State
House by Federal courts continued until 1854. Consolidation of the
city and districts in that year made more room necessary for city offices,
and the Federal courts were forced to move. Their place was taken
over by City Councils. The court room on the west was occupied by
the Common Council. On the east, the partition between the former
offices of the court clerks was removed, and a single room was fitted
for the Select Council. These Councils occupied the upper floor until
1895.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small"><i>Independence Square</i></span></h2>
<p>Until the 1820&rsquo;s, Independence Square was known variously as &ldquo;State
House Yard&rdquo; or &ldquo;State House Garden.&rdquo; Originally the land bounded
by Chestnut, Walnut, Fifth, and Sixth Streets had been set aside by
William Penn as &ldquo;bonus lots.&rdquo; To each purchaser of a substantial farm
or &ldquo;country lot,&rdquo; Penn also gave a city lot as a bonus. The pieces in this
particular square were given to Welsh Quakers who settled in Radnor
Township.</p>
<p>By the time the ground along Chestnut Street was acquired to erect
the State House, most of the original owners had already sold their
parcels. By deed dated October 15, 1730, the first lot on the square
was purchased by William Allen for the use of the Province. Within
the next 2 years the entire Chestnut Street frontage, extending halfway
back to Walnut Street, had been secured. Construction of the State
House began in 1732.</p>
<p>The desire to provide a proper setting for the State House was evident
from the beginning. In the year that the building was begun, the
Assembly considered leveling the site and enclosing it with a board
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
fence &ldquo;in order that Walks may be laid out, and Trees planted, to
render the same more beautiful and commodious.&rdquo; As far as is known,
however, the landscaping was not carried out until considerably later.</p>

</div>
<p>On February 20, 1736, the Assembly determined on a most important
policy. An act vesting the State House and its grounds in trustees
provided: &ldquo;That no part of the said ground lying to the southward of
the State House as it is now built be converted into or made use of for
erecting any sort of buildings thereon, but that the said ground shall
be enclosed and remain a public open green and Walks forever.&rdquo; This
provision has been retained as a guiding principle in the development
of the square save for occasional deviations. On August 9, 1739, the
Assembly ordered &ldquo;that Materials be prepared for encompassing the
Ground with a Wall in the ensuing Spring....&rdquo; Two years later a
portion of this wall was taken down and rebuilt with a shingle cornice
added to carry off rain water.</p>
<p>Purchasing the remainder of the square was delayed nearly four
decades. On May 14, 1762, the Assembly directed that the balance of
the land be obtained, and by 1769 the necessary lots had been acquired.
In 1770, the Assembly enclosed the whole square with a brick wall
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
7 feet high, pierced at the center of the Walnut Street front by a tall
arched gateway with solid wooden doors.</p>
<p>At this time the square contained the State House, with its wings
and wooden sheds, and a small wooden platform erected in 1768.
The latter was constructed at the instigation of the American Philosophical
Society for observing the transit of Venus across the sun on
June 3, 1769. It is believed that the observatory stood about 40 feet
south of the east wing of the State House.</p>
<p>Although landscaping the State House Yard had been long discussed,
nothing of consequence appears to have been done in this
regard during the Colonial period. At the time of the American
Revolution, the square apparently was more or less barren, with no
planned landscaping or system of walks. Cannon, which must have
been a prominent feature of the yard, were parked within the walls.</p>

</div>
<p>With the return of peace, interest was again awakened in improving
the grounds. Landscaping was finally begun about 1784 under the
direction of Samuel Vaughan, a wealthy Jamaica sugar planter then
living in Philadelphia. In addition to the wide central walk of gravel,
leading from the tower door to the Walnut Street gate, and the
serpentine walks about the perimeter of the square, the most noticeable
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
feature of the yard was the assortment of 100 elm trees presented to
the Commonwealth by George Morgan, of Princeton. Shortly after
the landscaping was completed, the Reverend Manasseh Cutler visited
this square and described it in his journal as a &ldquo;fine display of rural
fancy and elegance.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The trees are yet small, but most judiciously arranged. The artificial
mounds of earth, and depressions, and small groves in the squares
have a most delightful effect. The numerous walks are well graveled
and rolled hard; they are all in a serpentine direction, which heightens
the beauty, and affords constant variety. That painful sameness, commonly
to be met with in garden-alleys, and other works of this kind,
is happily avoided here, for there are no two parts of the Mall that are
alike. Hogarth&rsquo;s &ldquo;Line of Beauty&rdquo; is here completely verified.</p>

</div>
<p>The next alteration of the State House Yard following Vaughan&rsquo;s
landscaping was undertaken in 1812. In that year, when the old wing
buildings were demolished to be replaced by &ldquo;modern&rdquo; office buildings,
the high brick walls were removed to allow a &ldquo;freer circulation
of air.&rdquo; In their place was erected in the following year, a low brick
wall, about 3 feet high, with a marble coping surmounted by a railing
of plain iron palisades. Access to the square was provided by a large
gate on Walnut Street and smaller ones on Fifth and Sixth Streets,
about halfway between Chestnut and Walnut.</p>
<p>Other changes affecting the early scene followed in 1876. Along
with such necessary improvements as resodding and new drainage,
broad steps were constructed in the center of the Walnut Street front
and at the corners on Fifth and Sixth Streets. Wide flagstone walks
were laid through the grounds in almost every direction from street to
street. The later addition of steps on Fifth and Sixth Streets, near
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
Chestnut, substantially established the condition of the square as it is
today.</p>
<p>Through the years the square has served varied purposes. It was
frequently the scene of mass meetings and public demonstrations.
Large gatherings met here frequently in the course of the critical days
before and during the early part of the Revolution. The most noteworthy
of these occurred on July 8, 1776, when, from the observatory
platform&mdash;described above&mdash;Col. John Nixon read publicly for the
first time that document since known as the Declaration of
Independence.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small"><i>Evolution of a Shrine</i></span></h2>
<p>The &ldquo;State House&rdquo; did not become &ldquo;Independence Hall&rdquo; till the last
half of the 19th century. This change in designation, which began
about the time of Lafayette&rsquo;s visit to America, is closely linked with
the evolution of the building as a national shrine.</p>
<p>Prior to 1824, there was but little reverence or regard for the State
House. The visit of the Marquis de Lafayette to Philadelphia in that
year, however, awakened an interest in the building which has persisted
to this day.</p>
<p>Elaborate preparations were made for the visit of the celebrated
friend of America, much of it centering around the State House, which
became the principal point of interest. Across Chestnut Street, in front
of the building, was erected a huge arch &ldquo;constructed of frame work
covered with canvas, and painted in perfect imitation of stone.&rdquo; The
old Assembly Room, called for the first time &ldquo;Hall of Independence,&rdquo;
was completely redecorated. The walls and ceiling were painted stone
color, and windows were &ldquo;hung with scarlet and blue drapery studded
with stars.&rdquo; Portraits of Revolutionary heroes and the Presidents virtually
filled the available wall space. Mahogany furniture was &ldquo;tastefully
and appropriately disposed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lafayette was formally received in the &ldquo;Hall of Independence&rdquo; by
the Mayor and other dignitaries on September 28. On the days following,
during his week-long visit, the chamber served as his levee room.</p>
<p>The interest in the State House engendered by Lafayette&rsquo;s visit was
not permitted to die. In 1828, the City Councils obtained plans and
estimates to rebuild the wooden steeple which had been removed in
1781. After heated discussions, William Strickland&rsquo;s design for the
new steeple was accepted, a large bell to be cast by John Wilbank was
ordered, and Isaiah Lukens was commissioned to construct a clock.
Work was completed on the project during the summer of 1828.</p>
<p>Strickland&rsquo;s steeple was not an exact replica of the original, but it
may be considered a restoration since it followed the general design
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
of its predecessor. The principal deviations were the installation of a
clock in the steeple and the use of more ornamentation.</p>
<p>Within 2 years after rebuilding the steeple, interest was aroused in
the restoration of the Assembly Room, or &ldquo;Hall of Independence.&rdquo;
On December 9, 1830, the subject of the restoration of this room &ldquo;to
its ancient Form&rdquo; was considered by the Councils. Shortly afterward,
John Haviland, architect, was employed to carry out the restoration.
Apparently, Haviland confined his work to replacing the paneling
that is said to have been removed but fortunately was preserved in the
attic of the building.</p>
<p>The proper use of the room was always a knotty problem. Following
the Haviland restoration, the room was rented on occasions for exhibiting
paintings and sculpture. Its principal use, however, was as a
levee room for distinguished visitors, including Henry Clay, Louis
Kossuth, and other famous personages, in addition to many Presidents
of the United States from Jackson to Lincoln.</p>
<p>In the 1850&rsquo;s, and during the critical years of the Civil War, veneration
for the State House became even more evident. In 1852, the
Councils resolved to celebrate July 4 annually &ldquo;in the said State House,
known as Independence Hall....&rdquo; This is the first clear-cut use
of the term &ldquo;Independence Hall&rdquo; to designate the entire building.</p>

</div>
<p>Perhaps the best expression of this veneration is in the grandiloquent
words of the famed orator Edward Everett, who, on July 4, 1858, said
of the State House, or as it has now come to be known, Independence
Hall: &ldquo;Let the rain of heaven distill gently on its roof and the storms
of winter beat softly on its door. As each successive generation of those
who have benefitted by the great Declaration made within it shall
make their pilgrimage to that shrine, may they not think it unseemly
to call its walls Salvation and its gates Praise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On July 4, 1852, the delegates from 10 of the Thirteen Original
States met in Independence Hall to consider a plan to erect in the
square one or more monuments to commemorate the Declaration of
Independence. For various reasons, their deliberations proved fruitless.</p>
<p>During the years after the restoration of the Assembly Room in 1831,
a few paintings and other objects were purchased by, or presented to,
the City for exhibition. One of the first acquisitions was the wooden
statue of George Washington, by William Rush, which long occupied
the east end of the room. It was not until 1854, however, that the City
made any real effort to establish a historical collection for Independence
Hall. In that year, at the sale of Charles Willson Peale&rsquo;s gallery, the
City purchased more than 100 oil portraits of Colonial, Revolutionary,
and early Republican personages.</p>
<p>Following the acquisition of Peale&rsquo;s portraits, the Assembly Room
was refurnished and these paintings hung on the walls. On February
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
22, 1855, the Mayor opened the room to the public. From that day on,
many relics and curios were accepted by the City for display in this
chamber.</p>

</div>
<p>During the Civil War, the &ldquo;Hall&rdquo; (or Assembly Room) served a
solemn purpose. From 1861 on, the bodies of many Philadelphia soldiers
killed in the war, and, in 1865, the body of President Lincoln lay
in state there. Such use of the room was not new, however, for John
Quincy Adams, in 1848, Henry Clay, in 1852, and the Arctic explorer,
Elisha Kent Kane, in 1857, lay in state in the venerable room.</p>
<p>In 1860, a movement was begun by the children of the public
schools of Philadelphia to erect a monument to Washington. When
the fund was nearly raised, the Councils provided a space on the pavement
directly opposite the Chestnut Street entrance. The statue, executed
by J. A. Bailey, was unveiled on July 5, 1869.</p>

</div>
<p>Little beyond actual maintenance of the buildings seems to have
occurred until 1872 when, with the approach of the Centennial of the
Independence of the United States, a committee for the restoration of
Independence Hall was named by the Mayor. The committee entered
upon its duties with energy. Furniture believed to have been in the
Assembly Room in 1776 was gathered from the State Capitol at Harrisburg
and from private sources. Portraits of the &ldquo;founding fathers&rdquo;
were hung in the room. The president&rsquo;s dais was rebuilt in the east end
of the room, and pillars, thought to have supported the ceiling, were
erected. The red paint which had been applied to the exterior of the
building was removed from the Chestnut Street side. When accumulated
layers of paint were removed from the first floor interior walls,
the long-hidden beauty of carved ornamentation was again revealed.</p>
<p>During the Centennial restoration project, a large bell (weighing
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
13,000 pounds) and a new clock were given to the City by Henry
Seybert for the steeple of Independence Hall. This clock and bell are
still in use.</p>

</div>
<p>With the close of the Centennial celebration, Independence Hall
experienced a period of quiet, disturbed only by the increasing numbers
of visitors. Then toward the close of the 19th century, another restoration
cycle began, but its emphasis was quite different from that of any
in the past. Except for the replacement of the steeple in 1828, all
restoration work heretofore had been concentrated in the east or
Assembly Room on the first floor. Finally, in the 1890&rsquo;s interest extended
from the Assembly Room to the remainder of the building. An
ordinance of the Common and Select Councils, approved by the Mayor
on December 26, 1895, called for the restoration of Independence
Square to its appearance during the Revolution. A committee of City
officers concerned with public buildings and an advisory committee of
leading citizens were named by the Mayor to carry out the work. On
March 19, 1896, a resolution of the Councils granted permission to the
Philadelphia Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution
to proceed with the restoration of the old Council chamber on the
second floor of Independence Hall.</p>
<p>Between 1896 and 1898, the committees and the Daughters of the
American Revolution carried out a most extensive program of restoration.
The office buildings designed by Robert Mills were replaced
by wings and arcades which were more like those of the 18th century.
The first-floor rooms of Independence Hall were restored, and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
Daughters of the American Revolution attempted to restore the entire
second floor to its Colonial appearance by reconstruction of the long
room, the vestibule, and the two side rooms. A dummy clockcase,
similar to that of the Colonial period, was rebuilt outside on the west
wall, but the planned moving of the clock back to its 18th-century
location was not carried out. With the completion of this work, the
old State House had been restored to a close approximation of its
original design. For the first time in almost a century the building
appeared practically as it did during the American Revolution.</p>
<p>During the 19th century, the program of restoration and preservation
had been concerned largely with work on Independence Hall,
little thought having been given to the entire group of historical
structures on the square. In fact, according to an act of the General
Assembly approved August 5, 1870, the other buildings on the square
were to be demolished. Fortunately, this act was never carried out;
it was finally repealed in 1895.</p>

</div>
<p>With the 20th century, emphasis shifted from Independence Hall
to the remainder of the group. Although some restoration work had
been done in Congress Hall by the Colonial Dames of America in
1896, their efforts were confined to the Senate chamber and to one
of the committee rooms on the upper floor. Additional restoration of
Congress Hall was not undertaken until the American Institute of
Architects became interested in the matter. In 1900, the Philadelphia
Chapter of this organization made a study of the documentary evidence
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
available on the building and began an active campaign for its
restoration. Finally, in 1912, funds became available and the City
authorized the beginning of work under the auspices of the Philadelphia
Chapter. This was completed in the following year, and
President Wilson formally rededicated the building. In 1934, additional
work was done in the House of Representatives chamber.</p>

</div>
<p>The restoration of Congress Hall at Sixth Street brought into sharp
contrast the condition of the Supreme Court building (Old City Hall)
at Fifth Street. For many years the American Institute of Architects
and other interested groups urged the City to complete restoration of
the entire Independence Hall group by working on the Supreme Court
building. This phase of the program, delayed by World War I, was
not completed until 1922.</p>
<p>With the completion of restoration projects, the buildings on Independence
Square presented a harmonious group of structures in
substantially the appearance of their years of greatest glory. The
neighborhood in which they were situated, however, had degenerated
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
into a most unsightly area. Therefore, the improvement of the environs
of Independence Hall, containing a large concentration of significant
buildings, was the next logical development.</p>
<p>This movement to preserve the historic buildings in Old Philadelphia,
and incidentally to provide a more appropriate setting for them,
had long been considered. During World War II, the nationwide
movement for the conservation of cultural resources became particularly
active in Philadelphia, and much was done to coordinate the
work of different groups. In 1942, a group of interested persons, including
representatives of more than 50 civic and patriotic organizations,
met in the Hall of the American Philosophical Society and
organized the &ldquo;Independence Hall Association.&rdquo; This association
was the spearhead of a vigorous campaign which resulted in stimulating
official action to bring about the establishment of Independence
National Historical Park Project.</p>

</div>
<p>Conceived as a means of reclaiming some of the neighborhood
around Independence Square and to preserve the many significant
historical buildings in the area for the benefit and enjoyment of the
American people, the historical park is being developed by the concerted
efforts of the City of Philadelphia, the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, and the United States of America.</p>
<p>In 1945, the State Government authorized the expenditure of funds
to acquire the three city blocks between Fifth and Sixth Streets from
the Delaware River bridgehead at Race Street to Independence Square.
This project of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, officially designated
&ldquo;Independence Mall,&rdquo; provides for the demolition of almost all
buildings within the authorized area to make room for a great concourse,
thereby forming a dignified approach to Independence Square.
By the summer of 1953, all buildings in the first block, between
Chestnut and Market Streets, had been demolished and the ground
prepared for landscaping.</p>
<p>The Federal area was defined by an act of the Congress (Public
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
Law 795, 80th Congress) after the matter had been studied intensively
by a Federal commission named in 1946. The principal area covers
three city blocks between Walnut and Chestnut from Fifth to Second
Streets, with subsidiary areas on either side to include important historic
sites, such as the property adjacent to old Christ Church, the site
of Franklin&rsquo;s home, and an area leading from Walnut Street to old
St. Mary&rsquo;s Church. A surprising number of significant buildings are
included within the park boundaries. The First and Second Banks of
the United States, the Philadelphia Exchange, and the Bishop White
and Dilworth-Todd-Moylan houses are the principal historic buildings
included in the Federal area. Carpenters&rsquo; Hall and Christ Church
will not be purchased, but their preservation and interpretation have
been assured through contracts with the Department of the Interior.</p>

</div>
<p>The contribution of the City of Philadelphia to the historical park
is by far the most vital. On January 1, 1951, the custody and operation
of the Independence Hall group of buildings and the square were
transferred, under the terms of a contract, from the City to the National
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
Park Service. The title to the property will remain with the City.
Earlier, in 1943, the buildings were designated a national historic site
by the Department of the Interior. Since assuming custody of the Independence
Hall group, the National Park Service has carried out an
extensive program of rehabilitation of these historic structures; also,
many facilities for visitors have been provided for the dissemination
of the history of the Independence Hall group, as well as that of the
other structures in the park. In addition, a far-reaching project of historical
and architectural research has been undertaken. The facts
gathered in this research will enable plans to be developed which will
assure the public of deriving the maximum benefit from a visit to this
most important historical area.</p>
<p>It is fortunate that these old structures have survived, sometimes
through accident rather than design, so that they may serve as tangible
illustrations of this Nation&rsquo;s history for the inspiration of this and
succeeding generations of Americans.</p>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small"><i>The Story of a Symbol</i></span></h2>
<p>The Liberty Bell is the most venerated symbol of patriotism in the
United States; its fame as an emblem of liberty is worldwide. In the
affections of the American people today it overshadows even Independence
Hall, although veneration for the latter began much earlier. Its
history, a combination of facts and folklore, has firmly established the
Liberty Bell as the tangible image of political freedom. To understand
this unique position of the bell, one must go beyond authenticated
history (for the bell is rarely mentioned in early records) and study the
folklore which has grown up.</p>
<p>The known facts about the Liberty Bell can be quickly told. Properly,
the story starts on November 1, 1751, when the superintendents
of the State House of the Province of Pennsylvania (now Independence
Hall) ordered a &ldquo;bell of about two thousand pounds weight&rdquo; for
use in that building. They stipulated that the bell should have cast
around its crown the Old Testament quotation, &ldquo;Proclaim liberty
throughout all the land, unto all the inhabitants thereof.&rdquo; Most likely,
this phrase was chosen in commemoration of William Penn&rsquo;s Charter
of Privileges issued 50 years earlier.</p>
<p>Thomas Lester&rsquo;s foundry at Whitechapel, in London, was the scene
of casting the bell. Soon after its arrival in Philadelphia, in August
1752, the brand new bell was cracked &ldquo;by a stroke of the clapper
without any other viollence as it was hung up to try the sound.&rdquo; At
this juncture, those now famous &ldquo;two ingenious workmen of Philadelphia,&rdquo;
Pass and Stow, undertook to recast the cracked bell. After
at least one recorded failure to produce an instrument of pleasing tone,
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
their efforts were successful, and, in 1753, the bell began its period
of service, summoning the legislators to the Assembly and opening
the courts of justice in the State House.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig54">

booklet, <i>The Liberty Bell</i>, published by

of Pennsylvania.</p>
</div>
<p>With the threat of British occupation of Philadelphia in 1777, the
State House bell and other bells were hastily moved from the City to
prevent their falling into British hands and being made into cannon.
Taken to Allentown, the bell remained hidden under the floor of the
Zion Reformed Church for almost a year. In the summer of 1778,
upon the withdrawal of the British, it was deemed safe to return the
bells to Philadelphia.</p>
<p>By 1773, the State House steeple had become so dangerously weakened
that it was removed in 1781 and the bell lowered into the brick
tower. Some 50 years later, in 1828, when the wooden steeple was
rebuilt, a new and larger bell was acquired. The old bell, almost forgotten,
probably remained in the tower. The new one was obtained,
perhaps, because the original had either cracked or had shown indications
of cracking. Traditionally, the fracture occurred while the
bell was being tolled during the funeral procession of Chief Justice
John Marshall some 7 years later. In 1846, an attempt was made to
restore the bell&rsquo;s tone by drilling the crack so as to separate the sides
of the fracture. This attempt failed. The bell was actually tolled for
Washington&rsquo;s birthday, but for the last time, for the crack began to
spread.</p>
<p>Now that the bell was mute, useless as a summoner or sounder of
alarms, it began to assume a new and more vital role. Over the years
it came to be a symbol of human liberty&mdash;a very substantial symbol of
2,080 pounds of cast metal&mdash;inscribed with the Biblical admonition to
&ldquo;proclaim liberty.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Between 1854 and 1876, the Liberty
Bell stood on display in the

representing the Thirteen
Original States.</i> Sketch by Theo. R.
Davis in <i>Harper&rsquo;s Weekly</i>, July 10,
1869.</p>
</div>
<p>It is difficult to find the exact beginnings of this veneration for the
Liberty Bell. Independence Hall, the building with which it is so
intimately associated, began its evolution as a patriotic shrine about
the time of Lafayette&rsquo;s visit in 1824, but the bell, rarely mentioned
earlier, still received no notice. Illustrative of this lack of interest,
perhaps, is the late 19th-century tradition, only recently disproved,
that in 1828 the Liberty Bell was offered as scrap metal valued at $400
in partial payment to the manufacturer for the new State House bell.</p>
<p>Probably the first use of the bell as a symbolic device dates from 1839.
In that year, some unknown person apparently noted the forgotten
inscription on the bell. This was immediately seized upon by adherents
of the antislavery movement who published a pamphlet, entitled
<i>The Liberty Bell</i>. This is also the first known use of that name.
Previously, the bell was called the Old State House Bell, the Bell of the
Revolution, or Old Independence. That publication was followed by
others which displayed the bell, greatly idealized, as a frontispiece.
Thus the bell became identified with early antislavery propaganda,
invoking the inscription of a promise of freedom to &ldquo;all the inhabitants.&rdquo;
During this time, it is interesting to note, the symbolism of the bell
served a narrow field; little, if any, thought was given it as a patriotic
relic.</p>
<p>But patriotism was the next logical step. In the first half of the 19th
century the bell became the subject of legendary tales which it has not
been possible to verify. These legends have been recited in prose and
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
poetry; they have found their way into children&rsquo;s textbooks; and they
have contributed greatly to rousing the patriotic enthusiasm of succeeding
generations of Americans. Accepted by all classes of people,
these legends have done more than anything else to make the bell an
object of veneration.</p>

Wood engraving in David Scattergood, <i>Hand Book of the State House</i>, Philadelphia, 1890.</p>
</div>
<p>The patriotic folklore apparently began with George Lippard, a
popular novelist of Philadelphia. It was Lippard who wrote that most
thrilling and irrepressible tale of the bell, the vivid story of the old
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
bellringer waiting to ring the bell on July 4, 1776. This tale first appeared
in 1847 in the Philadelphia <i>Saturday Courier</i> under the name,
&ldquo;Fourth of July, 1776,&rdquo; one of a collection called <i>Legends of the
Revolution</i>.</p>
<p>The popularity of Lippard&rsquo;s legend soon brought imitations. The
noted Benson J. Lossing, gathering material for his popular <i>Field
Book of the Revolution</i>, visited Philadelphia in 1848 and recorded the
story. This gave the legend historical credence in the minds of Lossing&rsquo;s
host of readers. Taking the story presumably from Lossing, Joel Tyler
Headley, another well-known historian, included it with certain variations
of his own in his <i>Life of George Washington</i>, which was published
first serially in 1854 in <i>Graham&rsquo;s Magazine</i> and then in book
form.</p>

</div>
<p>Firmly established as history by Lossing and Headley, Lippard&rsquo;s
story also found poetic expression. The date of the first poem on this
theme has not been established, but, once written, it found its way
into school readers and into collections of patriotic verse. The most
widely read was probably G. S. Hillard&rsquo;s <i>Franklin Fifth Reader</i>, issued
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
in 1871, although the poem had been in popular use for some time
before. Beginning with &ldquo;There was a tumult in the city, in the quaint
old Quaker town,&rdquo; the poem became a popular recitation piece which
every schoolboy knew. The best known lines read:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Hushed the people&rsquo;s swelling murmur,</p>
<p class="t">Whilst the boy cries joyously;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Ring!&rdquo; he&rsquo;s shouting, &ldquo;ring, grandfather,</p>
<p class="t">Ring! Oh, ring for Liberty!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Quickly at the given signal</p>
<p class="t">The old bellman lifts his hand.</p>
<p class="t0">Forth he sends the good news, making</p>
<p class="t">Iron music through the land.</p>
</div>
<p>The growing legend of the Liberty Bell aroused curiosity in the
relic itself, hidden from view in the tower. It was consequently brought
down to the first floor of Independence Hall. In 1852, during a convention
of delegates from the Thirteen Original States in Independence
Hall, the bell was placed on a temporary pedestal in the Assembly
Room&mdash;the east room. Two years later the temporary platform was
replaced by a massive pedestal having 13 sides ornamented by Roman
fasces, liberty caps, and festooned flags. The bell was topped by Charles
Willson Peale&rsquo;s mounted eagle.</p>
<p>In this position the Liberty Bell remained until a more intense interest,
awakened by the approaching celebration of the Centennial
Anniversary, caused it to be moved to the hallway. Here it was mounted
on its old wooden frame which had been found in the tower. A plain
iron railing enclosed the bell and frame.</p>
<p>The bell stayed in this location for only a short time. A few years
later it and the frame were placed in the Supreme Court Chamber&mdash;the
west room&mdash;near one of the front windows. Displaying it in its heavy
wooden frame evidently proved unsatisfactory, because the bell itself
was practically concealed. The next move, therefore, was to suspend
it from the ceiling of the tower room by a chain of 13 links.</p>
<p>Probably because the inscription was difficult to read while the bell
was suspended from the chain, it was lowered about 1895, placed in
a large, glass-enclosed mahogany case, and again put in the Assembly
Room. For 20 years it remained in this case, located part of the time
in the Assembly Room and part of the time in the tower room.
Finally, it was decided that visitors should be permitted to touch the
bell, which was removed from the glass case in 1915 and exhibited
on a frame and pedestal. With the whole arrangement on wheels, it
could be quickly rolled out of the building in an emergency. This is
the manner in which it is displayed today. Located just inside the south,
or tower, door, the Liberty Bell is illuminated at night so that visitors
may see it from Independence Square.</p>

<p>The growing importance of the Liberty Bell as a patriotic symbol
aroused popular demand for its movement around the country so that
more people could see it. The first long journey was in the winter of
1885 to New Orleans and through the South. Later trips took
the bell to Chicago in 1893, to Atlanta in 1895, to Charleston in 1902,
to Boston in 1903, and to San Francisco in 1915. On each trip the
arrival of the bell was the occasion for celebrations by patriotic groups
and citizens, many of whom traveled long distances to see and touch
the venerated relic. During these trips, however, the crack in the bell
increased, and finally its condition became so dangerous that all future
travel had to be prohibited.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig62">
<img src="images/p33.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="616" />
<p class="pcap"><i>This group is typical of the hundreds of thousands of visitors who come annually
from every corner of the world to see the Liberty Bell.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The affectionate reverence inspired by the Liberty Bell is demonstrated
by the endless stream of visitors who come to see it, touch it,
or simply stand quietly beside it. No other patriotic relic in America
has had a more distinguished visitation. Almost every President of the
United States since Abraham Lincoln has come to Independence Hall
to pay his respect to the Liberty Bell. Statesmen and great military
leaders of the world have joined the masses of ordinary people in
honoring it. Poets and other literary figures have attempted to express
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
the meaning of the bell, and John Philip Sousa, the &ldquo;March King,&rdquo;
composed a <i>Liberty Bell March</i>. It has been pictured on postage stamps,
fifty cent pieces, and on national bond drive posters.</p>
<p>The Liberty Bell has served to arouse the patriotic instincts of more
than one generation of Americans. It is today surrounded by a cloak
of veneration. Even more, it has come to be regarded by countless
millions throughout the world as the one great symbol of freedom,
liberty, and justice.</p>

one of the finest examples of
Greek revival architecture in the
United States, was erected between
1819 and 1824 to house the Second

controversy between President
Jackson and the Whigs over the renewal
of the charter, the bank closed
in 1836. It was then chartered by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, but
finally failed in 1841. From 1845 to
1934, the building was the Philadelphia
Custom House. In 1939, the

the Continental Congress to draft the
Declaration of Independence. Franklin
had an important part in the successful
negotiation of the Treaty of
Alliance between France and the
United States, in 1778, which was
largely responsible for the success of

<blockquote>
<p><i>I have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments
embodied in the Declaration of Independence and I have pondered over the
dangers which were incurred by the men who assembled here and adopted
that Declaration of Independence and I have pondered over the toils that were
endured by the officers and soldiers of the army who achieved that independence.
I have often inquired of myself, what great principle or idea it was that kept
this Confederacy so long together. It was not the mere matter of the separation
of the colonies from the mother land; but something in that Declaration giving
liberty, not alone to the people of this Country, but hope to the world for all future
time. It was that which gave promise that in due time the weights should be
lifted from the shoulders of all men, and that all should have an equal chance.
This is the sentiment embodied in that Declaration of Independence.</i></p>
